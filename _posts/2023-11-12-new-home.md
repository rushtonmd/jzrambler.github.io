It has a new (new) home!  

After almost a year of staying at an intermediary location, the Rambler made its way here to Atlanta at the end of August. Huge thanks to Mark for being so responsive when I initially inquired about the car and for continuing to field my questions, regardless of how simple they may be.  

I hope to continue the car's legacy here, and I already have some 'opportunities' I'm working through regarding the state of programming in which I received it. All in due time!  

It's just such a joy to drive around!
